      <h2>A story from a victim</h2>
      <p>It all started on my mission. There I was, eating a delicious 5 peso waffle in the Philippines when suddenly a
        goose came up and started hissing at me. What else hisses you may ask? The answer is snakes and snakes are bad.
        The hissing
        continued and I was not impressed by this snow of aggression. Like the peaceful missionary I was, I put up my
        umbrella between the goose and me. I couldn't leave and I had done nothing. Little did I know this was the only
        action needed for war. The goose came around, looked at me and then but my
        leg. Needless to say I was not impressed. It was like throwing a rubber duck at Hercules and thats approximately
        what 'it' instigated. I shooed the satanic honking abomination away but that vile creature did not relent.
        Little did it know, it brought a knife to a
        rubber shoe fight. I had worn the right shoes that day, rubbery crocs that can bounce anything away and I had
        been practicing my kicking abilities, believing I was the karate kid, after all, I was in Asia. The goose
        continued to bite me, my fuse burned
        short then it got what it had so eagerly bartered for. A square kick send it tumbling into the field. Not enough
        to injure it, after all it was 0.001 percent of my kicking power. It turned and I started walking towards it
        again, suddenly logic clicked and it started to leave. An important lesson was taught that day: there are no
        rewards,
        there are no punishments; there are only consequences. Even now, I think of my important role that day, as a
        teacher of fortune cookie-like wisdom.

      <h2>Geese are evil ducks</h2>
      <p>Though not explained in the Bible, there are animals that may mimic the behavior of Satan, they are snakes,
        mosquitos and most certainly, <strong>geese.</strong> Geese are devious creatures that contribute nothing to the
        well fare of
        others and
        are often violent to their own kind. In an ecosystem so balanced, so perfected with evolutions through time,
        geese are an ashtray on a motor cycle, that is worthless.</p>
      <h3>Are your children texting about geese? Terms to look for:</h3>

      <h3>What can we do to avoid geese-induced trauma?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Avoid: They are always bad and no encounter with a goose ends well</li>
        <li>Disengage: A goose may approach you, try to avoid it</li>
        <li>Be prepared: A few simple kicking exercises can both impress and save you and your companions</li>
        <ul>
          <li>A simple front kick can be practiced with rocks in the road</li>
          <li>A more complicated spin kick disables a flock at at time through power and fear. Visit a marshall arts
            academy for this skill.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Never designed to be peaceful</h2>
      <p>I want you to consider the way that the English language articulates the wording surrounding geese, these are
        all entries how others describe these vile birds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Honking: like that of a car?</li>
        <li>Hissing: like the father of all lies, the devil himself, that great serpent</li>
        <li>Sloppy: like a sibling you did not ask for</li>
        <li>Rude: The equivalent of belching at a restaurant with 3 Michelin stars</li>
        <li>Loud: The world has enough hustle and bustle, we go to nature to escape it. Geese do not allow this.</li>
